# Adobe Experience Platform Consent Collection Mobile Extension


## About this project

The AEP Consent Collection mobile extension enables consent preferences collection from your mobile app when using the [Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/acp-sdks) and the Edge Network extension.


### Installation

Integrate the Consent extension into your app by including the following in your gradle file's `dependencies`:

```
implementation 'com.adobe.marketing.mobile:edgeconsent:1.+'
implementation 'com.adobe.marketing.mobile:edge:1.+'
implementation 'com.adobe.marketing.mobile:sdk-core:1.+'
```

### Development

**Open the project**

To open and run the project, open the `code/settings.gradle` file in Android Studio

**Run demo application**

Once you opened the project in Android Studio (see above), select the `app` runnable and your favorite simulator and run the program.

**View the platform events with Assurance**

Configure a new Assurance session by setting the Base URL to `testapp://main` and launch Assurance in the demo app by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ adb shell am start -W -a  android.intent.action.VIEW -d "testapp://main?adb_validation_sessionid=ADD_YOUR_SESSION_ID_HERE" com.adobe.marketing.mobile.consenttestapp
```

Note: replace ADD_YOUR_SESSION_ID_HERE with your Assurance session identifier.

Once the connection is established and the events list starts getting populated, you can filter the Edge Consent extension events by typing `Consent` in the `Search Events` search box.
